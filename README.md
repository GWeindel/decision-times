This is the supporting repository for the paper titled **Decision-making components and times revealed by the single-trial electro-encephalogram**

# Structure
All the results and figures are generated by the two notebooks:
- `1-HMP_analyses.ipynb` estimates the HMP model and analyses the by-trial effect of experimental factors on inter-event durations and event topography
- `2-ERP_analyses.ipynb` plots the ERPs and test the presence of the CPP
  
  
> [!Note]
> Running the analyses on the 512Hz EEG data as in the paper would require a computer with a fairly large amount of RAM (64GB)\
> To run it on a regular laptop downsample the data by changing line 25 of the notebook `1-HMP_analyses.ipynb` from `sfreq = info['sfreq'] ` to `sfreq = 100`

`data` contains all the data used for the code that produces the analyses and the plots (see specific README in `data/`)

`diagnostic_plots` contains plots that represent the individual fits of the Fechner, Linear and Pieron model to all the different durations used in the study (populated by running the notebooks)

`estimation_files` contains temporary data for the analyses

`plots` contains the plots generated to accompany the paper (populated by running the notebooks)

`experiment_code` contains the code that was used for the data collection

`hmp` is a frozen version of the HMP package (see specific README)

# Installation
> [!WARNING]
> Note that this workflow has only been tested on ubuntu 24.04, running it on windows will probably require some adaptations

**Installation instruction as of the 2025-06-26**:  The version 1.0.0-b.1 of HMP is not yet on pip, should this still not be the case by the time you try this code you can download and install HMP from the commit number that we used by cloning 
the repository at the commit number that was used to generate the results:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GWeindel/decision-times.git
cd decision-times
python -m venv /home/[yourhome]/venv/dec_times #or python3
source /home/[yourhome]/venv/dec_times/bin/activate  
git clone https://github.com/GWeindel/hmp.git
cd hmp
git checkout 601f0b9eac8bddd233c2a565336a71e809f5177b
python -m pip install jupyterlab bambi arviz #not included with hmp
pip install .
cd ../
jupyter lab
```

Feel free to open issues on this repository in case problems arise during reproduction
