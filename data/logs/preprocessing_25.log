Added the following bipolar channels:
EOGH, EOGV
The unit for channel(s) EXG1, EXG2, EXG4, EXG5, EXG6, Erg1 has changed from V to NA.
NOTE: pick_types() is a legacy function. New code should use inst.pick(...).
Trigger channel Status has a non-zero initial value of 65536 (consider using initial_event=True to detect this event)

Filtering raw data in 1 contiguous segment
Setting up low-pass filter at 40 Hz

FIR filter parameters
---------------------
Designing a one-pass, zero-phase, non-causal lowpass filter:
- Windowed time-domain design (firwin) method
- Hamming window with 0.0194 passband ripple and 53 dB stopband attenuation
- Upper passband edge: 40.00 Hz
- Upper transition bandwidth: 10.00 Hz (-6 dB cutoff frequency: 45.00 Hz)
- Filter length: 339 samples (0.331 s)

NOTE: plot_psd() is a legacy function. New code should use .compute_psd().plot().
Setting 651748 of 2650112 (24.59%) samples to NaN, retaining 1998364 (75.41%) samples.
Effective window size : 2.000 (s)
At least one good data span is shorter than n_per_seg, and will be analyzed with a shorter window than the rest of the file.
